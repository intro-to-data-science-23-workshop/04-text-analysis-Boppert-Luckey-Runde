# String processing with stringr and string


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2023.

- [Exercises](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop/04-text-analysis-Boppert-Luckey-Runde/blob/main/stringr_stringi_exercises.html)
- [Exercises With Solutions](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop/04-text-analysis-Boppert-Luckey-Runde/blob/main/stringr_stringi_exercises_with_solutions.html)

### Main learning objectives

The primary goal of this tutorial is to introduce students to the `stringr` and `stringi` packages and practice processing text data. We will start by doing an overview of text data in R, and then move onto comparing `stringr` to `stringi`. We will then work through some exercises to get practice with `stringr`.
