# What's a string?

# Quick Recap: What's a string?

We use strings to present text data:
--

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
string <- "Text Data"
```
A very literal, yet true example.

--

Strings are made up of characters, defined via single or double quotes and contain any text you want: 

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/String_example.png" width="200">

--

We can also store multiple strings in a vector:
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
c("Strings", "are", "great")
#> [1] "Strings"   "are"   "great"
```
Using tools like `grep()` and Regular Expressions, we can do a lot of string manipulation.

---

# So, I handle strings in base R then?

--
<img src = "https://en.meming.world/images/en/f/f7/Well_Yes%2C_But_Actually_No.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" width = "300">
--


Base R can be way too challenging in handling strings, especially on a larger scale:
--


We all know (and love) Regular Expressions, which is why we all immediately know what this line does:
--


```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
gsub("\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$", "", gsub("^.+@", "", emails[grep("[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", emails)]))
```
--

Great, me too! We can **quickly** see, this gsub intends to extract the domain of valid email addresses from a given input vector of strings:
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
emails <- c("jackson@MacBook", "jackson@students.hertie-school.org", "jackson", "jacksonmluckey@gmail.com", "lazy dog", "jackson@icloud.com")
```

# stringr | stringi
This is where our packages enter the game.

--

.pull-left[
<img src="images/stringr_logo.png" width="30%" />

- Part of the tidyverse, very intuitive use.

- Delivers many basic functions to extract, manipulate, subset, measure etc. string data.

- Easily identifiable via `str_`.

- Built on top of `stringi`.
]

--

.pull-right[
<img src = "images/stringi_logo.png" width = "35%" />

- More configurable and more than `stringr`.

- Can handle more complex tasks.

- Better for locale-specific conditions, such as language or time.

- Generally starts with `stri_`.

#stringr deep-dive

.pull-left[
<img src="images/str_detect.png" width="15%" />

We can use `str_detect()` to identify patterns.

**Example**: In academic research, you might want to extract references or citations from a body of text for further analysis. Detecting and extracting patterns like DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or citation styles can be crucial.


<img src="images/str_subset.png" width="15%" />

Use `str_subset()` on a user-defined pattern.

**Example**: When working with survey data, you might want to extract specific responses or categories from open-ended questions.
]

.pull-right[
<img src="images/str_pad.png" width="15%" />

Use `str_pad()` if you want to pad strings to a consistent length.

**Example**: You're working on a sentiment analysis project, using a bag-of-words approach to convert text data into numerical features.

<img src="images/str_replace.png" width="15%" />

`str_replace()` to replace all matched patterns in a string.

**Example**: You're analyzing a dataset of tweets or social media posts, and you want to anonymize certain information, such as usernames or email addresses for privacy reasons.
]
---
#Stringr deep-dive __||__
<img src="images/str_c.png" width="15%" />

`str_c()` to join multiple strings into one.

**Example**: You've finalized a data analysis project and want to generate a report that includes text descriptions along with dynamically generated values from your analysis.

--

<img src="images/str_sort.png" width="15%" />

`str_sort()` to sort strings alphabetically.

**Example**: You're working on a project, using a data set with categorical variables, such as product categories or similar. You want to sort the categories alphabetically for better visualization and analysis.

---
#Stringr and Regular Expressions

The power of `stringr` comes alive when **combined** with Regular Expressions.

--

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
string <- "It's not a bug â€“ it's a feature."
str_extract_all(string, "\\b\\w+\\b")
[1] "It"      "s"       "not"     "a"       "bug"     "it"     
[7] "s"       "a"       "feature"
```
This is very useful in Tokenized Natural Language Processing. Extracting single strings to separate between 'filler words' and those relevant to the research question.

--

For all text analyses projects, we have to clean the data to a certain extent, combining `stringr` and Regular Expressions can serve a great purpose, for example in standardizing data.

--

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
replacements <- c("USA" = "United States", "UK" = "United Kingdom")
data$text_column <- str_replace_all(data$text_column, replacements)
```

#Reasons to use stringi

--

`stringi` has extensive support for [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/), which makes it suitable for text-processing in basically any language.

--

It can switch between different locales, which is important when handling internationally sourced data.

--

`stringi` is the package `stringr` is built on top of and is highly specific in its use-cases.

If you cannot find a way to do the specific manipulation that you want to with `stringr` consider some additional [stringi resources](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringi/versions/1.7.12).

--

However, for most of your everyday string-manipulation and data cleaning tasks, we recommend using `stringr`, as it's more intuitive ans straight forward.
